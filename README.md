# drawing-garden
Project developed for the Fall 2018 semester of LMC 2700. I designed a drawing program that allows people to grow trees.

Controls:
Press the arrow keys to navigate the plots. Press Enter to grow the trees. You can click on the colors to customize the tree,
as well as save your work and clear the plots.
